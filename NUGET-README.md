# Umbraco.Pylon #
This project is set up to provide base classes and structures for developing well architected, developer focussed Umbraco solutions that maximise reuse and testability.

### Versioning ###
To keep it straightforward, NuGet packages of Umbraco.Pylon will always reflect the Umbraco version that they are intended to support / are dependent on with an optional supplemental fourth digit version number to indicate a version difference in Pylon itself.

The down side to this is it makes keeping track of major Pylon versions difficult.

* Pylon is now in it's third major version from 7.10.4.1 upward (Umbraco 7.10.4). With the advent of integrated Umbraco.ModelsBuilder, the philosophy of Pylon has adapted to be more simplified, removing complex elements that muddy the waters of minimalist high reliability coding. Pylon 3 is a significant change from Pylon 2 but much more streamlined.
* Pylon version 2 is available for Umbraco versions 7.2.1 (Pylon 7.2.1.3) to Umbraco 7.9.6.
* The original version of Pylon, which has since been retired, can be used on Umbraco 7.2.1 by installing version 7.2.1 of Pylon.

Pylon versions are tagged in Github, so if you are looking for older version documentation - It should be there!

Full ReadMe docs are on Github.
