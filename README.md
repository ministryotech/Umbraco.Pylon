Most of our content is stored on BitBucket, but we also do some Umbraco related projects and with Umbraco itself hosted on GitHub it made sense to host those there too.

## NuGet ##
Umbraco.Pylon can be installed in your project from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Pylon/)

## Using Umbraco.Pylon ##
More documentation and explanation of the different classes and how to use them will follow here after the nuget deployment is prepared.
